title: "User Roles"
---

Coder allows you to assign different roles to users, and each role comes with a
distinct set of privileges regarding what the user can access and which actions
they can perform.

There are four roles available:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Role</b></td>
            <td><b>Description</b></td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Site Admin</b></td>
            <td>Grants full access to the system. Note that here can only be one
             Site Admin per system</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Site Manager</b></td>
            <td>Allows access to all administrative functionality in
            addition to basic usage rights</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Auditor</b></td>
            <td>Offers auditing functionality</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Member</b></td>
            <td>Allows basic usage of Coder</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Changing a User's Role

By default, all new users are assigned the **Member** role. These users can be
upgraded to **Auditor** or **Site Manager** by another user with administrative
privileges.

To change a user's role, go to **Manage** > **Users**. Find the user and use the
**Site Role** drop-down to change the assigned role.
