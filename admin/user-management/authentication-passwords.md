You can change the authentication method by which a user logs into their Coder
account.

To do so, go to **Manage** > **Users**. Find the user whose authentication type
you want to change, and use the **Auth Type** to toggle between **Built-In** and
**OpenID Connect**.

## Resetting a User's Password

> Password resets are only available for users using **Built-In**
> Authentication.

To reset a user's password, go to **Manage** > **Users**. Find the user whose
password you want to reset and click the **vertical ellipses** icon associated
with that user.

Click **Reset Password**. You'll be shown a temporary password that you can
provide to the user.

When the user logs in using the temporary password, they will be prompted to
change it.
