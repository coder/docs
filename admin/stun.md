Coder supports the use of [WebRTC STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN),
enabling direct connections to workspaces. Direct connections to workspaces help
avoid the need to proxy traffic, reducing latency.

To connect to workspaces using WebRTC STUN:

1. In the Coder UI, go to **Manage** > **Admin** > **Infrastructure**.
1. Scroll down to P2P Workspace Connections, and provide the **STUN URI**.
