## Service banners

The service banner allows you to display a message to all users of your Coder
system. The user can dismiss the message at any time and Coder will not display
a banner until you change the message (or disable and re-enable the current
message).

1. Go to **Manage** > **Admin** > **Appearance** in the Coder UI.
1. Toggle the **Service Banner** switch to **On**.
1. Set the **Message**.
1. Click **Save Preferences**.
