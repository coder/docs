You can manage your Coder licenses using the Dashboard when logged in as a site
manager.

To view your current license details, go to the **License** tab on the **Admin**
page. This is also where you can upload a new license file if you'd like to
replace the currently installed license.

The **License** tab displays the details for your current license, including:

- The number of users you've been allocated
- When the license was issued
- When the license expires
