# Coder Docs

This repository contains the documentation source files for [coder.com/docs](https://coder.com/docs).

Is something confusing, unclear, or just want to contribute something new? [Open an issue or pull request](https://github.com/cdr/docs/issues/new)! While you can't currently build the docs site locally, you'll be able to preview your changes in the context of the site through a deploy preview. 

Our documentation is published once a day, so merged pull requests may not be visible right away but will be visible within 24 hours.
