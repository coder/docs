The articles in this section will walk you through setting up a cluster to which
Coder deploys and then deploying Coder.

Coder is free to try, though you'll need a license to do so. You can
[generate a license](https://coder.com/trial) that allows you to try Coder free
of charge for 60 days. You'll provide this license _after_ you've completed the
deployment steps.

> If you're interested in a lightweight preview of Coder, check out our
> [Coder for Docker](coder-for-docker/index.md) option.

## Deploying Coder

1. Before you start, we recommend familiarizing yourself with Coder's
   [requirements](requirements.md).

1. To begin the deployment process, see our docs on creating a
   [Kubernetes cluster](kubernetes/index.md) and
   [installing Coder](installation.md).
