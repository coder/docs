In addition to running Coder in a web browser, you can also run each application
as a progressive web application (PWA). Using Coder as a PWA offers you an
experience akin to a native application and improved performance.

## Requirements

To use Coder as a PWA, you must be using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

## Installing the PWA

1. Log into Coder and select your workspace.
1. Under **Applications**, click on an application to launch it as a new window
   or tab.
1. Follow your browser's instructions for installing the application as a PWA.

Please note that applications are currently installed on a per-workspace basis.
