title: "Moving to Coder OSS Beta"
description: What you need to know about Coder OSS 
---

Coder OSS (also referred to as [Coder OSS](https://github.com/coder/coder))
is Coder's open core remote development platform first launched in June 2022.
This document shares best practices for moving your workflows from Coder v1 to
Coder OSS.

## High-level concepts

Coder OSS introduces a number of new paradigms. We recommend reading the comparison table before you proceed.

| | Coder v1 | Coder OSS |
| - | - | - |
| **Workspace** | Each user creates and develops on remote workspaces | Same as Coder v1 |
| **Supported IDEs** | Web IDEs (code-server, Jupyter) + SSH-powered desktop IDEs (e.g. VS Code, Jetbrains) | Same as Coder v1 |
| **Provisioner** | Provisions workspaces on Kubernetes with hardcoded spec (pod + home volume) | Provisions workspaces via [Terraform](https://terraform.io). Supports any resource (e.g. Windows VM, Kubernetes pod) | 
| **Template** | Optional YAML [configuration syntax](https://coder.com/docs/coder/latest/admin/templates) for workspaces. Managed by Coder admins or git/CI | [Terraform code](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/templates) that defines workspace specs. Managed by Coder admins or git/CI | 
| **Image** | Container image for workspace, contains dev tools and dependencies | Often included in [the template](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/templates) |
| **Workspace options** | CPU, RAM, GPU, disk size, image name, CVM (on/off), dotfiles | Defined as variables in [the template](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/templates) |
| **Deployment methods** | Kubernetes, Docker  | Kubernetes, Docker, VM, or bare metal |
| **Architecture** | Control plane + PostgreSQL database + workspaces | Same as Coder v1 |

## Migration Strategy

A seperate deployment is necessary to run Coder OSS. A direct upgrade via Helm is not possible since Coder OSS introduces new concepts (e.g. templates, provisioners) and other features are still being developed (e.g. audit log, organization support).

Short term, we recommend keeping your Coder v1 deployment and inviting a pilot group to your Coder OSS deployment to reproduce their workflows and try new features (e.g. Windows support, dynamic secrets, faster builds). 

### Feature list key

Please comment on any issues in the [coder/coder](https://github.com/coder/coder) repo or [contact us](https://coder.com/contact) if they are important to you.

✅ = Complete

⌛ = WIP/planned [on a roadmap](https://github.com/coder/coder/discussions/categories/roadmap)

🤔 = Still considering

❌ = No current plans for feature

### Infrastructure

For small "proof-of-concept" deployments, you can use Coder's [built-in database and tunnel](https://github.com/coder/coder#getting-started) on a VM to avoid setting up a 
database, reverse proxy, and TLS.

For production use, we recommend running Coder with an external PostgresSQL database and a reverse proxy for TLS.

<small>See the Coder OSS [installation docs](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/install) for more details. Something missing, or have feedback? [Let us know](https://coder.com/contact)</small>

### CLI

Coder OSS uses a seperate [command line utility](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/install). To use both CLIs on the same machine, you can install the Coder OSS CLI under a different name (e.g. `codeross`):

```sh
curl -sL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --method=standalone --binary-name=codeross > /dev/null

# Coder v1 CLI
coder workspaces list

# Coder OSS CLI
codeross list
```

### Users

Like Coder v1, you can [enable SSO via OpenID Connect](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/install/auth#step-2-configure-coder-with-the-openid-connect-credentials) so that any user in your federation can log in. Coder OSS optionally supports [GitHub (Enterprise)](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/install/auth#step-1-configure-the-oauth-application-in-github) and [username/password](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/users) authentication.

| | Coder v1 | Coder OSS |
| - | - | - |
| Avatar | ✅ | ❌ | 
| Dotfiles | ✅ | Per-workspace [(dotfiles docs)](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/dotfiles) | 
| Generated SSH key | ✅ | ✅ | 
| Default shell | ✅ | Per-workspace [(with parameters)](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/templates#parameters) | 
| Auto-start times | ✅ | Per-workspace | 
| Git OAuth | ✅ | SSH key only | 

<small>Something missing, or have feedback? [Let us know](https://coder.com/contact)</small>

User-wide settings (e.g. avatar, shell, autostart times, dotfiles URL) are not currently supported in Coder OSS [(#3506)](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues/3506).

### Workspaces

To migrate Coder v1 workspaces, you'll need at least one [template](https://coder.com/docs/coder-oss/latest/templates)
in your Coder OSS deployment, specifically with the image(s) you support in Coder v1.

> If you are interested in a bulk user and/or workspace migration utility, [we'd like to
> hear from you](https://calendly.com/bpmct/30min).

From there, we recommend manually creating a workspace in Coder OSS and using a utility such as `scp` or `rsync` to copy the home directory from your v1 workspace.

```sh
# Inside a Coder v1 workspace terminal (e.g. coder-v1.example.com)

# Download the Coder OSS CLI (alias "codeross")
curl -sL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --method=standalone --binary-name=codeross > /dev/null

# Log in to the Coder OSS deployment (e.g. coder-v2.example.com)
codeross login https://coder-v2.example.com

# Create a workspace
codeross create <workspace-name>

# Gain SSH access to v2 workspaces
codeross config-ssh -y

# Copy your home directory into the new Coder OSS workspace
rsync \
    --recursive \
    --itemize-changes \
    --info=progress2 \
    --links \
    --exclude='.cache/' \
    $HOME/. coder.$CODER_WORKSPACE_NAME:/home/coder/.
```
