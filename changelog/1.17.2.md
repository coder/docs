### Breaking Changes ❗

There are no breaking changes in 1.17.2.

### Features ✨

- Workspaces As Code (**WAC**): Workspaces as code (WAC) brings the
  _Infrastructure As Code_ paradigm to Coder environments. WAC allows you to
  define and create new environments using **workspace templates**.
  - web: New page available via **Admin** > **Templates** for creating an
    embeddable quickstart button.
  - web: New options available when clicking **New Environment** from the
    **Environments** page.
  - web: **workspace template** information is now displayed on the
    **Environments** page for environments built from a template.
- web: Added _Cordon_ and _Uncordon_ actions to _Provider_ audit logs.

### Bug Fixes 🐛

- infra: Fixes an issue whereby using `coder/configure` to create Dev URLs would
  fail.
- infra: Fixes an issue authenticating using OpenID Connect Identity Providers
  (IdPs) that omit name information, such as GitLab. In this case, Coder will
  use the email address as the user's name.
- infra: Improved validation for environment names. Previously, a long
  environment name may have caused build errors.
- web: The Dev URLs card on the **Environments** page now refreshes after an
  environment finishes building.
- jetbrains: Fixed an issue whereby Jetbrains IDE processes would start and
  always run. They now start on request when opening Jetbrains IDEs.
- web: Improved reliability of the workspace provider ping indicator.
- web: Fixed incorrect timestamps in an image's _Available Tags_ table.
