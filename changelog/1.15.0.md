### Breaking Changes ❗

- web: The root dashboard PWA manifest has been removed. Please uninstall the Coder PWA.
  Coder is moving forward with a PWA-per-application approach. To install
  `code-server PWA`:
  - click the `Code` application from the *Environments* page
  - Code Server will open in a new window (or tab) with a web manifest
  - Install the application
  - **Note:** Currently, the PWA scope is limited *per environment*. This means each
  environment requires that the `Code` application is installed as a PWA. We recognize
  that this is not an ideal workflow and as such, it will be addressed in a future
  iteration.

### Features ✨

- web: The Manage > Users table displays a notice on dormant accounts that will
  be removed within 30 days
- web: Admin Panel Cluster Info page has been added
- web: Admin Panel redesigns
  - The "General" page is now "Infrastructure", with a new design
  - Authentication, Appearance, Telemetry and Dormancy have been redesigned
- web: The code-server application can now be installed as a progressive web
  application. Click the code-server icon from the environments page, and then
  follow your browser's instructions for installing the web app. - **NOTE:**
  This application is installed _per environment_. This limitation will be
  addressed in future iterations.
- web: Hovering an image in the summary card on the `Environments` page elicits
  displays a Tooltip with extended information
