description: "Released on 01/20/2021. Deprecated on 01/25.2021."

> **Deprecation Notice:** This version is no longer available from the `helm`.
Please use version `1.15.1`. A bug in `1.15.0` caused migrations from existing
instances with environments to fail. Our release testing process covers
migrations from the previous version, but not with environments. We have since
updated our release process to cover this case.

### Breaking Changes ❗

- web: The root dashboard PWA manifest has been removed; uninstall the
  Coder PWA. In lieu of this, Coder is moving forward with a PWA-per-application
  approach. To install the Code Server PWA:
  1. Log into Coder and select your environment.
  2. Under **Applications** click **code** to launch code-server.
  3. Follow your browser's instructions for installing the PWA.
- web: Deprecated **Services** in favor of [CVMs](../environments/cvms)

### Features ✨

- web: Added 30-day notices to dormant accounts listed in the **Manage** >
  **Users** table; this warning indicates these accounts will be removed if not
  reactivated
- web: Added **Cluster Info** page to the Admin Panel. In the future, this page
  will contain the administration and configuration of multiple clusters.
- web: Redesigned Admin Panel
  - Renamed the **General** page to **Infrastructure** and updated page with a
    new design
  - Redesigned the **Authentication**, **Appearance**, **Telemetry** and
    **Dormancy** pages
- web: Changed how Progressive Web Apps function; the code-server application
  can now be installed as a PWA.
- web: Added tooltip with extended information that shows when hovering over the
  Image info in the summary card on the `Environments` page
- web: Redesigned the Coder Dashboard to use NextJS and SSR. Page loads should
  be quicker ⚡.

### Bug Fixes 🐛

- infra: Fixed the removing of query strings from Dev URL authentication
  redirect
- infra: Changed the dotfiles install.sh script so that it is invoked as a child
  process instead of `exec`'d. This ensures the remainder of `~/personalize`
  executes after `install.sh`.
- jetbrains: Fixed the appearance of window title and close buttons
- jetbrains: Changed the behavior of links; opening URLS and/or clicking links
  opens a new tab
- jetbrains: Fixed access to the context menu from then Terminal toolbar
- web: Removed display containing environment resources information if the
  environment isn't running
- web: Updated the Import an Image dialog window to hide image tags that have
  already been imported
- web: Updated the Create/Edit an Environment dialog; images and tags are now
  sorted alphabetically and then chronologically by creation date
