### Breaking Changes ❗

- web: Removed the root dashboard PWA manifest has been removed; uninstall the
  Coder PWA. In lieu of this, Coder is moving forward with a PWA-per-application
  approach. To install the Code Server PWA:
  1. Log into Coder and select your environment.
  2. Under **Applications** click **code** to launch code-server.
  3. Follow your browser's instructions for installing the PWA.
- web: Deprecated **Services** in favor of a declarative approach to creating
  environments with YAML called **Environments as Code**. This feature is slated
  to be released with Coder v. 2.0 (ETA: Q1 of 2021). For now, services will
  continue to function as-is, though this feature will not receive any
  improvements; they will be removed with Coder v. 2.0
