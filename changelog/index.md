## Release schedule

[Coder release calendar (iCal file)](https://coder.com/release-calendar.ical)

- Release _candidates_ begin appearing on the **second Wednesday** of each month
  (Coder may create multiple release candidates prior to the actual release)

  - We do not provide documentation for release candidates, and you should not
  use them unless you've been instructed to do so by Coder. You can identify
  release candidates by the presence of `-rc` in the version number (e.g.,
  `1.16.0-rc.1`).
  
- Releases are available on the **third Wednesday** of each month
- _Patch_ releases become available as needed
