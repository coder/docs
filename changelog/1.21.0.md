### Breaking changes ❗

There are no breaking changes in 1.21.0.

### Features ✨

- Satellites
- web: Added ability to cancel the workspace build process after it's been
  started.
- web: Updated workspace status bar to better display workspace status (e.g.,
  "Creating workspace").
- web: Updated workspace providers management screen (**Manage** >
  **Providers**) to include edit and delete options, as well as an organizations
  selector.
- web: Added ability to specify Kubernetes `tolerations` and `nodeSelector` for
  workspaces. This can be done via **Manage** > **Providers**; select the
  provider of interest and click **Edit**.
- web: Added support for multiple SSH keys, allowing the addition of one SSH key
  per OAuth application (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). Previously, Coder only supported
  one SSH key across all deployments.
- infra: Renamed Kubernetes labels still referring to environments to
  workspaces.
- infra: Added ability to write audit logs to the container's stdout/stderr.
- infra: Added SSH agent forwarding support when not using OpenSSH
- web: Updated footer to display license information to site admins and site
  managers.

  3 days remain.

  username instead of an auto-generated username based on their email.
- infra: Added additional logging to OAuth processes.
- web: Renamed the `WorkspaceBuilder/WAC` directory to
  `WorkspaceBuilder/Templates` and renamed `workspaces as code` to
  `workspace templates`.
- web: Changed Coder's JWE query parameter so that `token` can be used as a
  query parameter in dev URLs.
- web: Updated minimum disk size requirement when creating a workspace to 1 GB
  and maximum disk size constraint to 8 TiB.

### Bug fixes 🐛

- web: Fixed issue where dev URL session cookies were not using the root path.
- cli: Fixed issue with white border appearing in terminal windows.
- web: Fixed issue where audit log showed the time when the workspace deletion
  was requested instead of when it was deleted.
- infra: Fixed API issue where routes returning daily active user metrics were
  incorrect.
- web: Fixed issue where user deletion took an extended period of time (users
  will now be deleted faster).

### Security updates 🔐

- infra: CSRF tokens are now added to all non-GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, or TRACE HTTP
  calls, while all POST, PATCH, DELETE calls required a CSRF token if using
  `cookie` for authentication.
- infra: New keys are generated using the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm
  instead of ECDSA.
- infra: Updated function to generate unbiased random strings for generating
  secret values, such as API keys, default site admin passwords, auto-generated
  passwords for password reset.
- infra: Added support for running Coder's control plane containers with
  OpenShift's restricted security context constraints (SCC).
- web: Added functionality to strip extraneous cookies from dev URLs.
- infra: Added functionality to disable browser features not needed by Coder,
  including accelerometer, autoplay, battery, camera, document domain,
  geolocation, gyroscope, magnetometer, microphone, midi, payment, USB, VR,
  screen wake/lock, and XR spatial tracking
- web: Updated incorrect login message to be more generic.
