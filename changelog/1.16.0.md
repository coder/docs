### Breaking Changes ❗

- The deprecated `Services` feature is now **removed**. All resources created
  for Services are preserved for data recovery purposes (volumes,
  database tables, etc.), but are not accessible through the Coder platform.
  Please reference
  [Docker in Environments](../environments/cvms) for
  a guide on the new workflow for running containers with your Environment.
- The built-in Internal Extension Marketplace is now **removed**. All resources
  created for this feature are preserved for data recovery purposes, but are not
  accessible through the Coder platform. For air-gapped deployments, the `Custom`
  Extension Marketplace configuration enables the use of
  [Open VSX](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx) as
  an alternative.
- The [Container-based Virtual Machine](../admin/environment-management/cvms)
  environment option is now considered generally available. The
  admin-level configuration is still required, but the `alpha`
  warning has been removed.
- Environment SSH routing has new behavior. Please reference
  [this guide](../admin/environment-management/ssh-access.md).

### Features ✨

- Public Rest API: [documentation](apidocs.coder.com)
- Support for remote port forwarding over SSH
- Support for [running a full OpenSSH server](../admin/environment-management/ssh-access.md)
inside your Environment.

  removed. All non-CVM environments are launched with `privileged: false`.
