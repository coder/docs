### Breaking changes ❗

- Users upgrading deployments that predate the release of v1.21 should update
  their Helm values file to reflect Coder's [updated schema] if they haven't
  already. More specifically, users must change the following values:

  - `cemanager` --> `coderd`
  - `cemanager.replicas` --> `coderd.replicas`
  - `cemanager.image` --> `coderd.image`
  - `cemanager.resources` --> `coderd.resources`
  - `devurls.host` --> `coderd.devurlsHost`
  - `ingress.loadBalancerIP` --> `coderd.serviceSpec.loadBalancerIP`
  - `ingress.loadBalancerSourceRanges` -->
    `coderd.serviceSpec.loadBalancerSourceRanges`
  - `ingress.service.externalTrafficPolicy` -->
    `coderd.serviceSpec.externalTrafficPolicy`
  - `ingress.tls.hostSecretName` --> `coderd.tls.hostSecretName`
  - `ingress.tls.devurlsHostSecretName` --> `coderd.tls.devurlsHostSecretName`
  - `storageClassName` --> `postgres.default.storageClassName`
  - `timescale.image` --> `postgres.default.image`
  - `timescale.resources` --> `postgres.default.resources`
  - `timescale.resources.requests.storage` -->
    `postgres.default.resources.requests.storage`
  - `postgres.useDefault` --> `postgres.default.enable`
  - `deploymentAnnotations` --> `services.annotations`
  - `serviceTolerations` --> `services.tolerations`
  - `clusterDomainSuffix` --> `services.clusterDomainSuffix`
  - `serviceType` --> `services.type`
  - `serviceAccount.annotations` -->
    `coderd.builtinProviderServiceAccount.annotations`
  - `serviceAccount.labels` --> `coderd.builtinProviderServiceAccount.labels`
