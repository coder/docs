Developers should spend their time writing code, not on getting their
development environment working. Coder's goal is to empower organizations to
harness the cloud's power to provide consistent, secure, and performant
environments for their development teams.

Our software has been pulled over 19 million times from Docker, received over
40,000 stars on GitHub, and is used by some of the world's largest enterprises.
We're also working with pilot organizations to shape the future of remote
development through Coder.
