Coder moves software development to the cloud, centralizing your organizations'
development initiatives and offering improvements in development velocity and
enterprise security.

Coder's pre-configured environments allow project organization members to define
what language version and tooling are required to provide consistency across the
organization and allow new members to onboard and contribute. Developers focus
on their projects and the end product, not on setup.

These pre-configured environments are the foundation of Coder's *Dev
Environments as Code* paradigm, allowing a project's language and tooling
dependencies to be source controlled along with the code itself.

With Coder, engineers can continue using the development tools, CI/CD pipelines,
source code management systems, and editors they know and love while leveraging
the power of cloud and automation.
