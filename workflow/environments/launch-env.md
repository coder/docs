title: "Launch an Environment"
---

Once you've logged in to Coder, you can launch your environment from its
overview page.

* If you only have one environment, you'll see its overview page whenever you
  log in to Coder or navigate to the **Environment** overview page
* If you have multiple environments, Coder shows the overview for the last
  environment you used.

From the **Application** section of the overview page, click to launch the IDE
you want to use. Alternatively, you can launch the **Terminal**.
