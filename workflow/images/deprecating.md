2. In the top-right, click **Edit** to launch the **Edit Image** dialog.
3. (Optional) Update the **Description** to indicate the image is deprecated.
4. Select the **Deprecate this image** checkbox.
3. Click **Update Image** to save your changes.

> Users cannot create new environments using deprecated images. Still, they can
> continue to use *existing* environments created with the now-deprecated images
> and edit the provisioning parameters (e.g., CPU Cores, memory, and disk
> space).
