Images are the bases from which new environments are created.

Each image contains the language version, tooling, and dependencies users need
to work on a project. Users create environments from the image and can begin to
contribute immediately to the project for which it's defined.

Coder hooks into Docker registries, which store images that you can import. You
can source control the Dockerfile in your project's repository to provide your
organization with up-to-date information.
