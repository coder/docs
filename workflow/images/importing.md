Coder hooks into Docker [registries](doc:registries), and you can import images
in these registries for use.

To import an image, go to **Images** and select **Import Image** in the
upper-right. When prompted:

- Select the **Registry** where the image is hosted
- Provide the name of its **Repository**
- Provide the **tag** name if you'd like to import a specific image tag

Optionally, you can provide a **description** of the image (shown to all users)
and a **Source Repo URL** to point to the image's source.

Finally, you can specify the minimum amount of resources (cores, memory, and
disk space) the environment should have when using this image.
