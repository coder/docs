Coder supports linking your account to GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. When linked, Coder adds your generated SSH key — enabling easy clones of repositories.

> You must have a [Git Integration linked](../admin/git.md).

Navigate to "Preferences" -> "Linked Accounts", and go through the account linking process.
